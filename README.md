# Chennai-House-Price-Prediction-ML-Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Chennai using a dataset with features such as area, square footage, proximity to main roads, and house quality metrics. The target variable is SALES_PRICE.
Key Features:
Dataset Details: Includes variables like AREA, INT_SQFT, DIST_MAINROAD, N_BEDROOM, N_BATHROOM, N_ROOM, SALE_COND, PARK_FACIL, BUILDTYPE, UTILITY_AVAIL, STREET, MZZONE, QS_ROOMS, QS_BATHROOM, QS_BEDROOM, QS_OVERALL, and SOLD_AGE.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into feature distributions, correlations, and key trends.
Modeling: Implements machine learning models to predict house prices and evaluates their performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Technologies:
Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Goals:
Understand the key drivers of house prices in Chennai.
Build a predictive model to assist buyers and sellers with price estimation.
